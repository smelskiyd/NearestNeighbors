# NearestNeighbors

Implementation of Delaunay Triangulation and Nearest neighbour search in 2D-space.

Program test_generator.cpp can be used to generate a random input of any specific size.

Program main.cpp reads the file and creates an output image.

To use this code, you must have to install OpenGL and FreeGLUT libraries, for graphics.

# Examples of output

## N = 500

![image](/images/500points.png)

## N = 1000
